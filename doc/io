Temporary it uses 2 buffers: stdin and stdout. 
Stdin is a memory block where is copied content from keyboard buffer when it is requested.
Stdout is only a pointer to vga memory.

I/O functions:
	- printk -> write a formatted string to stdout (VGA memory only until implement pipes)
	- inb, outb -> read/write a byte
	- write -> write a buffer to stdout (VGA memory only until implement pipes)
